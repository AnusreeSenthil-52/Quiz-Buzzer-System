# Quiz-Buzzer-System
A digital logicâ€“based buzzer system that latches and displays the first of four buzzer presses using D flip-flops, AND gates, a 7447 BCD-to-7-segment decoder, and a 7-segment display. Upon the first button press, the system locks out subsequent inputs until reset and shows the corresponding player number (1, 2, 4, or 8) on the display.
